# `yulinARPES`: Chen group's ARPES data process software

This repository is designed to organize and maintain the current ARPES data processing software used in Chen's group, ensuring it remains up-to-date for all users. It is an ongoing project and will be updated periodically.

A manual for this software (`./Manual/manual.md`) is also available to help new group members become familiar with the software and data processing workflow.

The yulinARPES software and functions are the collective contributions of numerous group members across various generations (the full list can be found on the [group website](http://www.arpes.org.uk/People.html)).

This repository aims to serve as a valuable resource for storing, publishing, and bringing together the knowledge and efforts of past and present contributors.

Everyone is encouraged to provide feedback, contribute new functions, or help maintain the software. Your input and collaboration are greatly appreciated.
